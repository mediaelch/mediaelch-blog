      <description>The next version 2.12.0 is here!&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s new? It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly a year since the last MediaElch release. The reason is that I, the current maintainer, don&amp;rsquo;t find the time anymore to implement new features. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m limiting myself to bug fixes and smaller features.&#xA;This release is mostly about bug fixes again. IMDb and other sites have changed, and hence MediaElch needed to update its scrapers. But a few new features have made it as well: There is now a &amp;ldquo;TV Show Link&amp;rdquo; field for movies.</description>

      <description>The next version 2.10.6 is here!&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s new? Mostly bug fixes, including things such as poor performance, UI glitches, and some other bugs.&#xA;In version 2.10.4, there was a performance issue that made MediaElch unresponsive in certain situations, especially on systems with poor disk-speed (e.g. using HDDs instead of SSDs).&#xA;Changing the main-window theme no longer requires restarting MediaElch.&#xA;I fixed some issues with the dark main-window theme, where bright colors remained in previous versions.</description>

      <description>The next stable version 2.6.6 is here!&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s new? Two months since the last stable release, this one is a huge bugfix release.&#xA;Better Actor Images from IMDb Due to a change on IMDB&amp;rsquo;s site, images of actors only had a resolution of 32×44px. The scraper now loads each actor&amp;rsquo;s IMDb page and scrapes the image in high resolution of about 600×1000px. This also means that it will take longer to scrape a movie with actors from IMDb.</description>

      <description>I know it’s been a (too) long time since the last MediaElch release. I was quite busy last year setting up my own business and wanted the next release to contain a often requested feature. I finally found some time during the holidays and the last weeks to finish it: Music library management and scraping!&#xA;MediaElch now allows you to scrape your artists and albums. Although it’s not completely done and may contain some little glitches it is already usable.</description>

      <description>MediaElch 2.0 is available for download. Among bugfixes and little improvements (have a look at the Changelog for a complete list) there are also some nice new features:&#xA;Adult Scrapers One of the most requested features were adult scrapers in MediaElch. They are available now: AEBN, HotMovies and Adult DVD Empire can be used. These scrapers need to be enabled manually in the settings (Settings -&amp;gt; Scraper -&amp;gt; Adult Scrapers).</description>

      <description>This update took longer than expected… Some great new features were planned but I haven’t found the time to finish them and so Bajor is mainly a bugfix release. All changes can be found in the Changelog.&#xA;But there are also three things I want to show you:&#xA;Collection Export Starting with Bajor you can export your whole collection as HTML files. I’ve created a standard theme you can use already.</description>

      <description>The next version of MediaElch will have the option to export your whole library as html files. It will be possible to create your own export theme. As you can see in the screenshot I’m not a designer and there’s much room for improvement. It would be great if someone wants to create one or more themes for the export. The files are only plain html/css with some placeholders so you only need some knowledge of html/css :)</description>
