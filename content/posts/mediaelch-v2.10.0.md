The next version 2.10.0 is here! And we have some cool new features as well!


## What's new?

We've fixed many bugs, including crashes while starting MediaElch.
But we also have new features!

MediaElch finally has a dark theme for its main window!
You can change it in MediaElch's settings.  On macOS, we try to automatically
determine what theme you want.

Furthermore, MediaElch's TV show search now has a preview feature:

Similar preview windows will come for movies and concerts soon as well.

## Where can I download MediaElch?

Stable releases can be downloaded from <https://mediaelch.github.io/mediaelch-doc/download.html>
For Linux distributions we provide repositories for Ubuntu (.deb) and openSUSE (.rpm).

Please note that the macOS `*.dmg` file for macOS 11 or later is about 180MiB.
In the next release, it will be down to 70MiB again.
