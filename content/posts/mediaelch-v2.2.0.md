I know it’s been a (too) long time since the last MediaElch release. I was quite busy last year setting up my own business and wanted the next release to contain a often requested feature. I finally found some time during the holidays and the last weeks to finish it: **Music library management and scraping!**

MediaElch now allows you to scrape your artists and albums. Although it’s not completely done and may contain some little glitches it is already usable. Information is gathered via an „Universal Music Scraper“ which gets its data from The Audio DB, AllMusic.com and discogs.com. All three sites are queried and the information is joined together. In MediaElchs settings you can set which site you prefer so only missing information is filled with the help of the other sources. Images are always scraped from fanart.tv.

There is just one requirement: Your library must be organized by the following scheme: Every artist must be in its own subfolder and inside this folder every album must resist in its own folder. The top-level directory (this is where your artist folders are inside) must be added to MediaElchs sources.

There is also a little more info about it in our community forums (*update:* offline).

Beside the music scraping a lot of bugfixes and smaller improvements have made it into this release. See the [downloads page](https://mediaelch.github.io/mediaelch-doc/download.html) for a complete log.

As always my thanks go out to the contributors and translators of MediaElch. And very special thanks to all donators!
