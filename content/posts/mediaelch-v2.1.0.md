MediaElch 2.1 is now ready for [downloads](https://mediaelch.github.io/mediaelch-doc/download.html). There are some bugfixes, small improvements and also some new features in this version. A complete list of all changes can be found in the [download area](https://mediaelch.github.io/mediaelch-doc/download.html).

### Labels

LabelsMovies can now be marked with a colored label. These labels can also be filtered.

### Make MKV

MediaElchs import function was improved to use MakeMKV (MakeMKV needs to be installed separately). You are now able to import BluRays and DVDs directly into your collection.

### Community Forums

Weâ€™ve just launched our community forums (*update:* sadly the forum has been discontinued)! You can make feature requests there and report bugs. Every registered user can also vote for new features and give them a higher priority. Donators even get five votes every week and get access to the latest MediaElch development and beta releases.

Have fun with *Trill*!
