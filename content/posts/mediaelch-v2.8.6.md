The next version 2.8.6 is here! This is a bugfix release without any major internal changes.
As we plan some internal changes, we want to publish a new stable version before doing so.

## What's new?

This version fixes a few regressions and some other minor issues.

## Known Issues

There are some known issues that were not fixed in v2.8.6.
We will fix them in the near future.

 - The custom TV scraper may have issues with loading episodes details from
   other sources than TMDb.
 - The TMDb scraper does not load certain episode details like IDs when you
   load multiple episodes at once.
