The next MediaElch update is available for [download](https://mediaelch.github.io/mediaelch-doc/download.html).

Many smaller improvements and bugfixes have made it into this version as well as coverlib.com as source for album covers and booklets. Booklets provided there are in most cases scans of a double side in a single image. MediaElch now has an option to cut this covers in two pieces (just click on the little scissors below the image).

My thanks go out to all the supporters of MediaElch!

*Update*: MediaElch 2.3.2 fixed a bug where poster URLs were not stored in NFO files.
