The next version 2.10.6 is here!


## What's new?

Mostly bug fixes, including things such as poor performance, UI glitches,
and some other bugs.

In version 2.10.4, there was a performance issue that made
MediaElch unresponsive in certain situations, especially on
systems with poor disk-speed (e.g. using HDDs instead of SSDs).

Changing the main-window theme no longer requires restarting MediaElch.

I fixed some issues with the dark main-window theme, where bright
colors remained in previous versions.  And the Linux AppImage finally
displays icons properly.

When loading images, we now sort them according to your preferred
language.

I'd also like to thank all contributors, including all the people
that reported bugs and other issues!

For more, please refer to our [changelog].
