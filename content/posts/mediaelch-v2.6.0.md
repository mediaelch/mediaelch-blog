The next version 2.6.0 named "Ferenginar" is finally here!

## What's new?
This version fixes more than 20 bugs, has multiple small improvements and adds
various features. MediaElch now uses "https" for all scrapers that support it.
A few new audio and video codecs are now recognized as well.
We now support renaming concerts, creating subdirectories and detecting
duplicate movies, updated/fixed some XML fields for Kodi and much more.

MediaElch now has an official documentation which you can find at:
https://mediaelch.github.io/mediaelch-doc/

## Scrapers 
Because some scrapers were taken offline, we had to remove them.
Other scrapers were updated and fixed.

## UI: Linux
Attention Linux users. If you're using the KDE Breeze Dark theme then you'll love that MediaElch now supports it as well.

## What's next?
We will continue to improve MediaElch. We will further refactor the code base
of MediaElch to allow easier collaboration by new developers.
