The next version 2.8.18 is here! This is a bugfix release with some minor
improvements as well.

For package managers: We now fully support Qt6!


## What's new?

Mostly bugfixes such as scraper-updates, crash-fixes or Kodi NFO updates.
But we also have some new features!

For CSV exports, new fields were added such as "type" which may be useful for
post-processing of CSV files.  TMDb for concerts now loads
a concert's vote-count as well as its original title and TvMaze loads episodes' ratings.

Input fields that support placeholder now have a dropdown menu that
contains some suggestions, e.g. filename-suggestions as in the screenshot below:
