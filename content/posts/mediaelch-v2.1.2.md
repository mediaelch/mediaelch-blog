MediaElch 2.1.2 fixes some bugs which appeared in MediaElch 2.1 and 2.1.1. Especially the bug that dialogs showed up outside the desktops on Windows was fixed.

Some minor improvements were also integrated: Stream details are now available in export templates and new filters for audio qualities and channels were added.

Movie, tv show and concert lists show up the number of items now.

My thanks go out to all donators and supporters of MediaElch!
