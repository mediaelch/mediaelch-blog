The next version 2.8.16 is here! This is a bugfix release only.


## What's new?

Many smaller bugfixes as well as a fix for a serious crash in the
"Movies" section when downloading many movies at once.

There are also few UI improvements, e.g. the white text on white background
was fixed for the movie section.

Furthermore, more default sort tokens were added (for more languages).
If you want to change them, you need to add an `advancedsettings.xml` file.
