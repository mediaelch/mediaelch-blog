The next version 2.8.4 is here! This is mostly a bugfix release but there are a few
improvements and one new feature as well.

## What's new?

This version fixes a few regressions and fixes some scraper issues due to changes on
the metadata/image provider's end.

MediaElch now has an experimental CSV exporter! Find out how you can use it in the sections below.

## Fix Regressions and other Bugs

You may have noticed that opening the "image dialog"-e.g. by clicking a movie's poster--led to an
immediate network error message.  This was a bug. When the image dialog was opened, we enqueued
some downloads twice and some were aborted immediately which led to the error message.

If you tried to use movie sets, you have have noticed that you cannot add a movie to a set.
The "Add" button simply did not work.  This is now fixed as well.

There are more bugfixes so we suggest to update to the latest release.

## CSV Export

Often requested, a CSV export is added.  This feature is experimental and cannot be reached through the UI, yet.
You can open it by using the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+E</kbd> (<kbd>⌘+⇧+E</kbd> on macOS).

When the CSV export is finalized, we will add it to the UI.  Until then, only those who read our
changelogs and blog posts know of this. ;-)

## TVmaze

v2.8.2 introduced the TVmaze ID, v2.8.4 now brings a new TV scraper: TVmaze!
Not all features are supported but it may be worth to check it out!

### Other Changes to MediaElch

There are other useful changes that you may like. On macOS for example, MediaElch
no longer uses the discrete GPU!
This will save some of your battery's energy on MacBooks.


MediaElch now also adds a `<generator>` tag to all NFO files to indicate that they were
generated by MediaElch.  This is meant to help moderators on the Kodi.tv forum.  It will also
be used in the future to hold data that isn't supported by Kodi but MediaElch, i.e. more
meta data.

We also added IMDb and TMDb ID fields to the concerts view. We improved some of MediaElch's defaults
and improved our filename sanitizer in the renamer to remove leading dots as they indicate hidden
files on Linux and macOS.

We removed support for Kodi v16 NFO files.  Kodi v16 was released in 2016.
Please update to the latest release.
MediaElch can still read old NFOs but does not generate them anymore.

## Known Issues

There are some known issues that were not fixed in v2.8.4.
We will fix them in the near future.

 - The custom TV scraper may have issues with loading episodes details from
   other sources than TMDb.
 - The TMDb scraper does not load certain episode details like IDs when you
   load multiple episodes at once.
