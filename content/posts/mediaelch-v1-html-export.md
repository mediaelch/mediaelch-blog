The next version of MediaElch will have the option to export your whole library as html files. It will be possible to create your own export theme. As you can see in the screenshot I’m not a designer and there’s much room for improvement. It would be great if someone wants to create one or more themes for the export. The files are only plain html/css with some placeholders so you only need some knowledge of html/css :)

If you want to help just drop me a line: support@mediaelch.de
