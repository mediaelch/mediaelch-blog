This update took longer than expected… Some great new features were planned but I haven’t found the time to finish them and so Bajor is mainly a bugfix release. All changes can be found in the [Changelog](https://mediaelch.github.io/mediaelch-doc/release-notes.html#bajor-2013-08-08).

But there are also three things I want to show you:

### Collection Export

Starting with Bajor you can export your whole collection as HTML files. I’ve created a standard theme you can use already. Creating a custom export theme is not complicated so feel free to create your own and send it to me :) Two people already have done this and their themes will be available shortly.

There’s also a little howto available: https://kvibes.zendesk.com/entries/25040846-Creating-an-Export-Theme

### Media Passion Scraper

Many people requested it, now it’s there: the Media Passion scraper.

### Custom Scraper

You can now setup your custom scraper: Select which info should be loaded from which site.  
Thanks to all donators and translators!

Have fun with *Bajor*!
